# 文章总结-如何实现精度7位半仪器

In most cases, they also require high linearity, high resolution, good stability, and repeatability. <sup>[1][2]</sup>

线性，分辨率，稳定度，重复性。

Within all these applications, DMM is one of the most representative applications.

## 关键指标

### 分辨率

Resolution or digits: Resolution is often expressed in percent, ppm, counts,or bits.

- DMM’s resolution was mostly specified in terms of the number of digits displayed. Typically, this may be a number consisting of an integer and a half, for example, 6.5 digits. The half digit can display either 0 or 1.
- A typical 6.5-digit meter could display up to 1.199999 at a 1 V measurement range. A typical 7.5-digit meter displays up to 11.999999 at a 10 V measurement range.
- For some products the resolution is often expressed in bits, like ADCs. For example, a 24-bit ADC would give 2^24 distinct values, that is, 16777216 values (counts). The digits of resolution = lg(16777216) = 7.2. Note the effective resolution of a 24-bit ADC is normally less than 24 bits, which means its effective digit is less than 7.2.
